 FH resale costs
This notebook is a repository for tracking and analysing all costs related to a London based property. The aim is to compare all costs of homeownership vs renting over the same period of time 2016 - 2014. The project will extract actual cost expenses
from annual budget files, transform, filter and consolidate data into a single dataframe. Missing costs for some years will be estimated based on actual costs of the same type. 
The resulting dataframe will be plotted on a chart to analyse costs over time.
